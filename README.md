 Developed a machine learning model to predict and detect oil spill events using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object
 detection algorithm. The project aimed to enhance environmental monitoring and response efficiency by accurately
 identifying potential oil spills in satellite imagery. Processed and annotated large datasets of satellite images by using
 Roboflow for training and evaluation and Implemented data augmentation techniques.
